=== CRITICAL PERFORMANCE FIXES ===
Fixes: 3.4MB Material Symbols font, render-blocking CSS, LCP image, caching, legacy JS

FILES CHANGED:
1. src/components/icons/Icons.tsx
2. src/components/FrontPage/Navbar.tsx
3. src/app/[locale]/globals.css
4. src/components/FrontPage/TemplatesShow.tsx
5. next.config.ts
6. package.json
7. tsconfig.json

--- src/components/icons/Icons.tsx ---
REPLACED: Material Symbols font icons with @iconify/react SVG icons
- Removed all <i className="material-symbols-outlined"> usage
- Replaced with <Icon icon="material-symbols:icon-name" /> from @iconify/react
- Icons now load as inline SVG (no 3.4MB font file needed)

EXPLANATION: Eliminates 3.4MB Material Symbols font from critical path. Icons load as lightweight SVG instead of requiring a massive font file. Fixes "Avoid chaining critical requests" audit.

--- src/components/FrontPage/Navbar.tsx ---
REMOVED: import "material-symbols"
- Material Symbols font import removed
- Icons now use @iconify/react (already installed)

EXPLANATION: Removes Material Symbols font from being loaded in Navbar (above fold). Font was blocking initial render.

--- src/app/[locale]/globals.css ---
REMOVED: @import "material-symbols" and .material-symbols-outlined CSS class
- Font import and styles removed
- No font file needed anymore

EXPLANATION: Removes Material Symbols font CSS from global bundle. Eliminates 3.4MB font file from critical rendering path.

--- src/components/FrontPage/TemplatesShow.tsx ---
CHANGED: Regular <img> to next/image with optimization
- Added: import Image from "next/image"
- Changed: <img> to <Image> with width={1200} height={662}
- Added: priority={activeTab === 0} for LCP image (first tab)
- Added: sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 590px" for responsive loading
- Added: quality={85} for WebP/AVIF optimization

EXPLANATION: Optimizes LCP image (/images/temp/1sst.jpg) with next/image. Enables WebP/AVIF conversion, responsive sizes, and priority loading. Fixes "Improve image delivery" audit.

--- next.config.ts ---
ADDED: Cache-Control headers for static assets
- /_next/static/:path* → Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable
- /_next/chunks/:path* → Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable
- /_next/media/:path* → Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable
- /images/:path* → Cache-Control: public, max-age=2592000, stale-while-revalidate=86400
- /cdn-cgi/scripts/:path* → Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400, stale-while-revalidate=3600

CHANGED: images.unoptimized: true → formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp']
- Enables Next.js image optimization for WebP/AVIF

EXPLANATION: Adds proper cache headers for hashed assets (1 year immutable) and images (30 days). Enables WebP/AVIF image optimization. Fixes "Cache lifetimes" audit.

--- package.json ---
REMOVED: "material-symbols": "^0.31.2" from dependencies

EXPLANATION: Removes unused Material Symbols package (replaced with @iconify/react).

--- tsconfig.json ---
CHANGED: "target": "ES2017" → "target": "ES2020"

EXPLANATION: Modern target reduces polyfills/transforms. Saves ~13.6KB in legacy JS. Fixes "Legacy JS" audit.

=== SUMMARY ===

A) MATERIAL SYMBOLS FONT (3.4MB) - FIXED ✅
- Replaced with @iconify/react SVG icons
- No font file needed, icons load as inline SVG
- Removed from package.json and all imports
- Impact: Eliminates 3.4MB from critical path

B) RENDER-BLOCKING CSS - ALREADY OPTIMIZED ✅
- Material Symbols CSS removed from globals.css
- Below-fold components use dynamic imports
- Impact: Reduced initial CSS bundle

C) LCP IMAGE OPTIMIZATION - FIXED ✅
- Using next/image with priority for first tab
- WebP/AVIF enabled, responsive sizes
- Explicit width/height prevents CLS
- Impact: Faster LCP, better image delivery

D) CACHE-CONTROL HEADERS - FIXED ✅
- Hashed assets: 1 year immutable
- Images: 30 days with stale-while-revalidate
- Cloudflare script: 1 day cache
- Impact: Better cache utilization

E) LEGACY JS REDUCTION - FIXED ✅
- Target updated to ES2020 (from ES2017)
- Reduces polyfills/transforms
- Impact: ~13.6KB saved in legacy JS

EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS:
- Critical chain: 3.4MB font removed → faster initial load
- Cache lifetimes: Proper headers → better repeat visits
- Image delivery: WebP/AVIF + responsive → smaller, faster images
- Legacy JS: Modern target → less polyfill overhead

TO VERIFY:
1. npm install (removes material-symbols)
2. npm run build
3. Check Lighthouse: Critical chain should not include Material Symbols font
4. Check Network tab: Images should be WebP/AVIF, assets should have proper cache headers
